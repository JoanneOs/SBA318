👩‍💻 What are we doing?
We’re building a website that acts like a control center for a trucking company called TriWay. This website helps managers and drivers see important stuff like trip info, who’s driving, and where trucks are going.
But this isn’t just a regular website like YouTube or Roblox — we’re building it from scratch using Node.js and Express, which is like using LEGO blocks for websites, but with code!
🧱 What’s in our project (the folders and files)?
We organized our project like a school backpack with different folders to keep things neat:
controllers/ – This is like the brain of the website. It decides what to do when someone clicks a button or asks for info.
models/ – This is like the notebook where we keep all the info, like trips and drivers.
routes/ – These are the directions that tell the website, “Hey! If someone goes to this page, show them this info.”
views/ – These are the actual pages people see, like the home page, driver portal, and manager portal.
middleware/ – These are helpers that check things like passwords, errors, and keep logs (like little hall monitors).
public/ – This is where we keep decorations! Colors, pictures, and scripts to make the page look and feel nice.
data/ – This is where we keep our pretend data, like a little database in a file.
server.js – This is the main switch that turns everything on.
📋 What is the goal?
We’re making a mini version of a real company’s website. Managers can add, update, and delete trips. Drivers can log in and see their info. And we’ll even make sure errors are handled nicely, like “Oops! That page doesn’t exist.”
